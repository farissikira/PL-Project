# PL-Project 
# Console-Based Text Editor

## __Project Explanation__

Console-Based Text Editor Project behaves like a regular Notepad on Microsoft.
Opening, saving, editing, finding, replacing, deleting and displaying the content are the options that our program provides.
Program is easy to maintain and it runs in the terminal where a user has the
provided options on how to use Text Editor without the usage of GUI.
It is written in C#, JavaScript and Python in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code IDE.

## __Goals__

The goals of this project are:

- learning and exploring new programming languages (C#, JavaScript and Python)
- using appropriate sources for coding
- learning how to work with files and their manipulation through built-in functions in C#, JavaScript and Python
- handling mistakes and errors throught project development


## __Features__


Code will be connected by a text file with the Notepad so changes made in the terminal
will be visible in the Notepad since this is not a GUI application.
